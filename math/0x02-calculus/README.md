## General
* Summation and Product notation
Summation = \sum
Product = 
* What is a series?
A series is the sum of all terms in a sequence e.i : 5+10+15+20

* Common series
Finite & Infinite

* What is a derivative?
the derivative is a way to show rate of change: that is, the amount by which a function is changing at one given point. it is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. Is the "moment-by-moment" behavior of the function

* What is the product rule?
the product rule is a formula used to find the derivatives of products of two or more functions

$$(f*g)' = f'*g + f*g'$$

* What is the chain rule?

The chain rule lets us "zoom into" a function and see how an initial change (x) can effect the final result down the line (g).

* Common derivative rules
    * Chain Rule
    * Product Rule
    * Power Rule

* What is a partial derivative?
the partial derivative takes the derivative of certain indicated variables of a function and doesn't differentiate the other variable(s).

* What is an indefinite integral?
* What is a definite integral?
* What is a double integral?

## 0. Sigma is for Sum
   
$$\sum_{i=2}^{5}i$$

1. 3 + 4 + 5
2. 3 + 4
3. 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
4. 2 + 3 + 4

## 1. The Greeks pronounce it sEEgma

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{4}(9i-2k) $$

1. 90 - 20
2. 36i - 20
3. 90 - 8k
4. 36i - 8k
