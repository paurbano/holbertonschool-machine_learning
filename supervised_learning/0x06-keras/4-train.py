    '''trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent
    Args:
        network is the model to train
        data is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, nx) containing the input data
        labels: one-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (m, classes) containing the
                labels of data
        batch_size: size of the batch used for mini-batch gradient descent
        epochs: number of passes through data for mini-batch gradient descent
        verbose: boolean that determines if output should be printed during
                training
        shuffle: boolean that determines whether to shuffle the batches every
                epoch. Normally, it is a good idea to shuffle, but for
                reproducibility, we have chosen to set the default to False.
        Returns: the History object generated after training the model
    '''
    History = network.fit(x=data, y=labels, batch_size=batch_size,
                          epochs=epochs, verbose=verbose, shuffle=shuffle)
    return History
